# 🧑‍💼 HR Analytics & Employee Retention Insights (Power BI + SQL)

A complete HR analytics project combining optimized SQL queries and an interactive Power BI dashboard. This project analyzes employee attrition, tenure, compensation trends, and job satisfaction using real HR datasets (`HR_1.xlsx` and `HR_2.xlsx`).

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To provide actionable insights to HR teams and business leaders on:
- Why employees leave
- Which departments face high turnover
- How compensation and promotion history impact retention

This is achieved by writing SQL queries to generate KPIs and visualizing them through a dynamic Power BI dashboard.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- 📊 Power BI Desktop – Used for interactive visualization and dashboard building  
- 📂 Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation  
- 🧠 DAX – Dynamic KPIs like Attrition Rate, Avg Working Years, etc.  
- 🧮 MySQL – Querying the HR tables to derive and validate KPIs  
- 📁 File Formats – `.pbit` (Power BI Template), `.sql` (query file), `.xlsx` (source tables)

---

## 🗃️ Data Sources

The following Excel files were used:
- `HR_1.xlsx` – Contains employee demographic and role data  
- `HR_2.xlsx` – Contains job history, compensation, and attrition-related information  

These files were used to write SQL queries and serve as input for the Power BI dashboard.

---

## 🔍 Key KPIs & Visuals

- ✅ Average Attrition Rate for All Departments  
- ✅ Average Hourly Rate of Male Research Scientists  
- ✅ Attrition Rate vs Monthly Income  
- ✅ Average Working Years by Department  
- ✅ Job Role vs Work-Life Balance  
- ✅ Attrition Rate vs Years Since Last Promotion  

Each KPI was first computed using SQL and then visualized in Power BI.

---

## 🧮 SQL Query Work

- Optimized queries using `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, and `CASE` statements  
- Created views to calculate attrition per department  
- Filtered and segmented data (e.g., Male Research Scientists’ pay)  
- Ensured all KPIs were validated before dashboard integration

> All queries are included in `Hr Analytics.sql`

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

- Fully interactive dashboard built using `.pbit` template  
- Slicers for Gender, Department, Marital Status, and Job Role  
- Insightful visuals with a mix of bar charts, line charts, and scatter plots  
- KPI cards for quick executive overview

## 📁 Files Included

- `HR_1.xlsx`  
- `HR_2.xlsx`  
- `HR Analytics Employee Attrition Analysis Project.pbit`  
- `Hr Analytics.sql`  
- `README.md`  
- `HR Analytics.png`
